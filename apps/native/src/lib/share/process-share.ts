// Pure coordinator that drives one share session's entries through their saves.
// It has NO React, Convex, or storage imports — every side effect (link, note,
// image save, persistence) is injected, so the orchestration is unit-testable
// with fakes and so a partial failure can never erase sibling successes.
//
// The contract (plan 004):
//   - classify(): convert resolved payloads into entries WITHOUT side effects,
//     treating malformed input (no contentUri, blank text, bad website URL,
//     unsupported types) as explicit failed/unsupported entries.
//   - processSession(): process each entry independently, retaining every
//     success and reporting each failure as data. Retry only re-attempts
//     `failed` entries; saved entries are never re-saved.
//   - onEntrySettled callback emits progress after each entry settles.
